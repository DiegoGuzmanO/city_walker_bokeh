# city_walker_bokeh
This project is about creating a prototype application for optimizing tourists journeys. 

## Motivation
This is a group project for a [Data Analyst bootcamp](https://datascientest.com/formation-data-analyst).
This prototype is built for the city of Paris only. The longterm goal is to make the algorithm run no matter the city, via webscraping. 
In his approach we will be using unsupervised machine learning (clustering), Geographical visualization and we also be applying algorithms related to the graph theory for itinerary optimization.
## Code style
Python -> Follow PEP8.
## Tech/framework used
[Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/)
## test
[see our prototype in action here !](https://share.streamlit.io/diegoguzmano/city_walker_bokeh/main/city_walker_BOKEH.py)
## Contribute
If you want to contribute, here are some optimizations that I see necesary : 
* Webscraping
* calculation of a "interest value" for weighting points of interest's importance
## Credits
This project was made in Group by Danyl Delaisser and Diego Guzman.
